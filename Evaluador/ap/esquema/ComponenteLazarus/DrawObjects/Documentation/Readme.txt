This is unfinished work, but the version 0.1 has the minimum necessary to do
useful stuff with the drawObjects in Lazarus:
- creating drawobjects,
- editing drawobjects.

There is no user manual, but the test example in the Tests directory provides an example
for each function, so it should be easy to use. 

This unit has been tested on Windows XP. 
It has been compiled with FPC 2.3.1 and Lazarus 0.9.29beta.
(See the tests directory for detailed results).

Additional Work to perform:
- see the TODO list in the code to complete the port work.
- complete the unit testing. How does one do graphical unit testing in FPC/Lazarus?
- UML Design to improve, (Use ModelMaker, version 9, and Open Office 2.4 for 
  those who don't have this Pascal UML tool,
- FPDOC documentation,
- Help documentation,
- complete the port, port to Linux.
- additional tests,


Enjoy!
