    //In deriving winding impedances from the measured impedance data input values, one winding with
    //a small impedance, in many cases negative, often results. In the extreme case, it is possible to
    //specify a set of measured impedances that themselves do not individually appear to challenge the
    //precision limits of typical power system calculations, but which result in one winding impedance of
    //nearly (or identically) 0.0. Such data could result in precision difficulties, and hence inaccurate
    //results, when processing the system matrices in power flow and short circuit calculations.
    //Whenever a set of measured impedance results in a winding reactance that is identically 0.0, a
    //warning message is printed by the three-winding transformer data input or data changing function,
    //and the windings reactance is set to the zero impedance line threshold tolerance (or to 0.0001 if
    //the zero impedance line threshold tolerance itself is 0.0). Whenever a set of measured impedances
    //results in a winding impedance for which magnitude is less than 0.00001, a warning message is
    //printed. As with all warning and error messages produced during data input and data modification
    //phases of PSS®E, the user should resolve the cause of the message (e.g., was correct input data
    //specified?) and use engineering judgement to resolve modeling issues (e.g., is this the best way to
    //model this transformer or would some other modeling be more appropriate?).

    //tity) or entirely of capacitor banks (each Bi is a positive quantity). In these cases, the shunt blocks

    //In specifying reactive power limits for setpoint mode voltage controlling switched shunts (i.e., those
    //with MODSW of 1 or 2), the use of a very narrow admittance range is discouraged. The Newton-
    //Raphson based power flow solutions require that the difference between the controlling equipment's

    //equipment (0.2 Mvar on a 100 MVA system base). It is recommended that voltage controlling

    //When MODSW is 3, 4 or 5, VSWLO and VSWHI define a restricted band of the controlled devices
    //reactive power range. They are specified in pu of the total reactive power range of the controlled
    //device (i.e., the plant QMAX - QMIN when MODSW is 3, MAXQ - MINQ of a VSC dc line con-
    //verter when MODSW is 4, and NiBi  NjBj when MODSW is 5, where "i" are those switched
    //shunt blocks for which Bi is positive and "j" are those for which Bi is negative). VSWLO must be
    //greater than 0.0 and less than VSWHI, and VSWHI must be less than 1.0. That is, the following
    //relationship must be honored:

    //             0.0 < VSWLO < VSWHI < 1.0

    //The reactive power band for switched shunt control is calculated by applying VSWLO and VSWHI
    //to the reactive power band extremes of the controlled plant or VSC converter. For example, with
    //MINQ of -50.0 and MAXQ of +50.0, if VSWLO is 0.2 and VSWHI is 0.75, then the reactive power
    //band defined by VSWLO and VSWHI is:

    //     -50.0 + 0.2*(50.0 - (-50.0)) = -50.0 + 0.2*100.0 = -50.0 + 20.0 = -30.0 Mvar

    //through:

    //     -50.0 + 0.75*(50.0 - (-50.0)) = -50.0 + 0.75*100.0 = -50.0 + 75.0 = +25.0 Mvar

    //The switched shunt admittance is kept in the working case and reported in output tabulations sepa-
    //rately from the fixed bus shunt, which is input on the bus data record (see Section 4.1.1.2).

    //Refer to Sections 4.8.4, 4.8.6 and 4.10.3.4 for details on the handling of switched shunts during

    //It is recommended that data records for switched shunts whose control mode is 5 (i.e., they control
    //the setting of other switched shunts) be grouped together following all other switched shunt data
    //records. This practice will eliminate any warnings of no switched shunt at the specified remote bus

    //"Fi" entered must be greater than zero. On each record, at least 2 pairs of values must be specified
    //and up to 11 may be entered.

    //The Ti values for tables that are a function of tap ratio (rather than phase shift angle) are in units of

    //example, a two-terminal dc line identified as dc line number 1 along with a multiter-
    //minal line numbered 1.

    //2. Multiterminal lines should have at least three converter terminals; conventional dc lines
    //consisting of two terminals should be modeled as two-terminal lines (see
    //Section 4.1.1.8).

    //3. Ac converter buses may be type one, two, or three buses. Generators, loads, fixed and
    //switched shunt elements, other dc line converters, and FACTS device sending ends are
    //permitted at converter buses.

    //4. Each multiterminal dc line is treated as a subnetwork of "dc buses" and "dc links" con-
    //necting its ac converter buses. For each multiterminal dc line, the dc buses must be
    //numbered 1 through NDCBS.

    //5. Each ac converter bus must be specified as IB on exactly one dc bus record; there may
    //be dc buses connected only to other dc buses by dc links but not to any ac converter bus.

    //6. Ac converter bus "IB" may be connected to a dc bus "IDC", which is connected directly
    //to ground. "IB" is specified on the dc bus record for dc bus "IDC"; the IDC2 field is
    //specified as zero.

    //7. Alternatively, ac converter bus "IB" may be connected to two dc buses "IDC" and "IDC2",
    //the second of which is connected to ground through a specified resistance. "IB" and
    //"IDC2" are specified on the dc bus record for dc bus "IDC"; on the dc bus record for bus
    //"IDC2", the ac converter bus and second dc bus fields (IB and IDC2, respectively) must be
    //specified as zero and the grounding resistance is specified as RGRND.

    //8. The same dc bus may be specified as the second dc bus for more than one ac converter
    //bus.

    //9. All dc buses within a multiterminal dc line must be reachable from any other point
    //within the subnetwork.

    //10. The area number assigned to dc buses and the metered end designation of dc links are
    //used in calculating area interchange and assigning losses in activities AREA, INTA,
    //TIES, and SUBS as well as in the interchange control option of the power flow solution
    //activities. Similarly, the zone assignment and metered end specification is used in
    //activities ZONE, INTZ, TIEZ, and SUBS.
